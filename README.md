# BroomNav: The Safe Route Companion

**BroomNav** is a spooky-themed, safety-focused navigation app that finds the safest route between two locations. 
Unlike traditional navigation apps that prioritize speed, BroomNav guides you along well-lit, lower-risk paths
while letting you report "spooky" or unsafe locations for others. Enjoy your travels — especially at night — with peace of 
mind and a playful Halloween flair!
